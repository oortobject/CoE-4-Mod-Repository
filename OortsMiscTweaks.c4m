## Unit tweaks. I honestly don't know why the prebat summon weapons are here but I don't really see a reason for them to be removed either, none of them are markedly useful in the larger scheme of things. Also I gave Centaurides because a) they have less health than Centaurs but less range? that doesn't make a whole lot of sense and b) fuck weird sexism, seriously.
